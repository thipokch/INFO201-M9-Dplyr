# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice
#  
# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
# install.packages('devtools')
# 
# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("hadley/fueleconomy")

# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame
View(vehicles)

# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997
vehicles.1997 <- vehicles[vehicles$year == 1997,]

# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame
unique(vehicles.1997$year)

# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
two.wheels.20.mpg <- vehicles[vehicles$drive == "2-Wheel Drive" & vehicles$cty >20,]

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
worst.hwy <- two.wheels.20.mpg$id[two.wheels.20.mpg$hwy == min(two.wheels.20.mpg$hwy)]

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
MakeYear <- function(make,year) {
  filtered <- vehicles[vehicles$make == make & vehicles$year == year,]
  return(filtered$model[filtered$hwy == max(filtered$hwy)])
}

# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
MakeYear("Honda", 1995)
